# Deep Reinforcement Learning Resources

A comprehensive collection of documentation, notes, and practical examples for learning deep reinforcement learning using PyTorch.

## Features

- ðŸš€ PyTorch-based development environment with CUDA support
- ðŸ“š Comprehensive documentation and tutorials
- ðŸ§ª Utility functions with tests
- ðŸ““ Jupyter notebooks for hands-on learning
- ðŸŽ® Integration with popular RL environments
- ðŸ”„ Semantic versioning with automated releases
- âš¡ Modern dependency management with uv
- âœ… Code quality enforced with pre-commit and ruff

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository
2. Open in VS Code with Dev Containers extension
3. The development container will automatically set up all dependencies using uv
4. Start exploring the tutorials and examples

## Development

### Local Setup

If you prefer to set up the environment locally instead of using the devcontainer:

1. Install uv: `curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`
2. Create a virtual environment: `uv venv`
3. Activate the virtual environment:
   - On macOS/Linux: `source .venv/bin/activate`
   - On Windows: `.venv\Scripts\activate`
4. Install dependencies: `uv pip install -e ".[dev]"`
5. Install pre-commit hooks: `pre-commit install`

### Running Jupyter Notebooks

To run Jupyter notebooks in Cursor:

1. Make sure you have the development dependencies installed:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -e ".[dev]"
   ```

2. Register the virtual environment as a Jupyter kernel:
   ```bash
   python -m ipykernel install --user --name=rl_resources
   ```

3. Open a notebook in Cursor:
   - Open any `.ipynb` file from the `notebooks/` directory
   - Cursor will automatically detect it as a Jupyter notebook
   - Select the `rl_resources` kernel from the kernel selector in the top-right corner

4. Start coding! You can:
   - Run cells with `Shift + Enter`
   - Add new cells with `B` (below) or `A` (above)
   - Use Markdown cells for documentation
   - Use code cells for Python code

### Code Quality

This project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality:

- **ruff**: Fast Python linter and formatter (replaces Black, isort, and many other tools)
- **pre-commit-hooks**: Various checks for files, YAML, JSON, etc.

To run the checks manually:
```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

### Versioning

This project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) principles:

- **MAJOR** version when making incompatible API changes
- **MINOR** version when adding functionality in a backward compatible manner
- **PATCH** version when making backward compatible bug fixes

Releases are automatically managed using [python-semantic-release](https://python-semantic-release.readthedocs.io/).
