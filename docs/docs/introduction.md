# Introduction

Currently I am working my way through two books:

* [Deep Reinforcement Learning in Action](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-reinforcement-learning-in-action)
* [Grokking Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://www.manning.com/books/grokking-deep-reinforcement-learning)

As well as other resources that I am watching that are listed in [Bibliography](bibliography.md)
