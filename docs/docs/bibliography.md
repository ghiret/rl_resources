## Online resources

As well as video lectures, there is a few resources that I have found and that I like because of what they explain or how they helped me understand a particular concept. Here's a list of some of them that:

* [OpenAI spinning up Deep Reinforcemente Learning](https://spinningup.openai.com/en/latest/)

* [Deep Reinforcement Learning: Pong from Pixels](https://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/)
