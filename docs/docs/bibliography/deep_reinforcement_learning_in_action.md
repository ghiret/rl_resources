## Summary

This book is a very practical introduction to Deep Reinforcemente Learning.
The theory is very superficial and the explanations are very handwavy.
This means that you can move fast and get to experiment with some advanced algorithms relatively quickly.
The caveat, at least for me, is that some of the results are not explained convincingly.
As someone who likes understanding it from first principles, this sometimes casuses confusions and side quests to understand the concepts before I can execute the notebooks.

### Chapter 2 - N-armed bandits


* [Notebook](https://github.com/ghiret/rl_resources/blob/main/notebooks/DeepReinforcementLearningInAction/Chapter2/Ch2_book.ipynb)

I found this chapter easy to understand and follow as it is still very superficial in terms of the concepts needed from the general theory.

### Chapter 3


* [Notebook](https://github.com/ghiret/rl_resources/blob/main/notebooks/DeepReinforcementLearningInAction/Chapter3/Ch3_book.ipynb)

This chapter is a great primer on deep Q-learning if you are willing to _believe_ some of the results without having a derivation. The first part introduces classical Q-learning with a neural network as a function approximation for a gridworld environment.

The naive Q-learning is improved upon with experience replay and target networks. Target networks I found hard to understand from their explanation and I had to go on a side quest which was best resolved by a talk from one of the authors of the Atari paper [Deep Q Networks @ DRL Bootcamp 2018](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fevMOp5TDQs)
