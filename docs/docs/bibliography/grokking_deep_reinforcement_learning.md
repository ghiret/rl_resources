## Summary

This book is a good introduction from scratch that is very thorough albeit a bit verbose at times.
The book starts with basic definitions in the same way as Barto & Sutton do, but does not dedicate so much time to the maths, it goes straight to the conceptual explanations based on multiple examples and executable code.
